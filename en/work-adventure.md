## Work Adventure

Our Work Adventure virtual world features dedicated spaces for formal presentations (stages for installations, rooms along the perimeter for each poster), as well as spots to gather with others, chat, or sit in silence together.

Work Adventure will be open throughout the entire conference. You can pop in at any time. We encourage you to explore the virtual world, make plans to meet up with other attendees for a virtual coffee or meal, and join us for our Work Adventure conference sessions.

Volunteers will be available to guide attendees during sessions scheduled in Work Adventure.

The link to our Work Adventure world will be shared in the Conference Agenda in ConfTool.

Accessing Work Adventure

To enter the virtual space, follor this [LINK](https://play.workadventu.re/@/association-for-computers-and-the-humanities-1747415862/ach2025/space-station-amongus)

For participation in the virtual world, you only need to use your internet browser—no dependencies or additional installations needed! While Work Adventure will work in every browser, we strongly recommend Chrome. If you experience any bugs, ensure that your browser is up-to-date. We recommend you close unused browser tabs and programs running on your computer to boost your connectivity. You may be prompted by your browser to turn “on” your video and audio. Be sure to click “Allow” when prompted.

Each presentation and poster will be assigned a specific virtual “Jitsi room” to screen share presentations (video, audio, slides, etc.). Jitsi is an open source video conferencing software. Each room will be labeled with its assigned presentation.

When you’re in proximity to a room, you’ll be prompted to hit the space bar. Doing so will allow you to enter the room and see the presentation being shared.

Captions can be enabled in Chrome. For Chrome, go to Settings > Accessibility, and then turn on “Live Caption.”

You can talk to any other conference attendee just about anywhere in the virtual world. When 2+ attendees come into conversation range, a circle appears around them, thereby enabling video/audio conversation. Chat is also possible, both across the entire virtual space and in specific “jitsi” rooms.

If you don’t want to engage when someone approaches, you can opt to not enable camera and mic.

If you feel uncomfortable or experience anything harmful, you can block that person from communicating with you by clicking on their avatar (you can rescind the block at any time). If you experience a Code of Conduct violation, please let a Work Adventure volunteer guide know and email Pam Lach (plach at sdsu dot edu) or the conference committee (conference@ach.org) per the ACH2024 Code of Conduct.
