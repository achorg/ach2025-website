Proposal authors will be prompted to review our [GDPR-compliant privacy statement](https://www.conftool.pro/ach2025/privacy.php) when creating a ConfTool account. Submissions and reviews will not be made available to the public. The Program Committee will have access to all submissions and reviews. Reviewers will be able to view only the proposals assigned to them for review. Authors will be able to view reviews of their submissions after the review process concludes. Names of reviewers will be displayed on a slide in an alphabetical list during the opening session of the conference in gratitude for their contribution.
