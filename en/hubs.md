# ACH 2026 Regional Hubs CFP


## Description:
As described in our [CFP](https://ach2026.ach.org/en/cfp/), ACH 2026 seeks to explore how we create and collaborate through moments of exigency in the conference theme of Emergence/ia. With the success of regional hubs during previous conferences, ACH looks to once again support smaller, more localized events related to the larger conference but centered in specific regions, whether geographical, national, or theoretical. 

Organizers can be creative in imagining their topographies for a regional ACH with the hubs being hosted by partners in physical or digital spaces. Through these hubs, ACH aims to facilitate knowledge exchange, community building, and ease-of-access while enhancing and expanding the mission of the Association. These regional hubs provide exciting opportunities for participation beyond the major conference and look to support new intersections for Digital Humanities research, teaching, and engagement.

Each regional hub will be hosted by local institutions independently but in conversation with the major conference, and we encourage hosts to be creative about how these regional hubs connect with the ACH 2026 Conference. To that end, we encourage organizers to plan for events (whether in-person or remote) that do not overlap with the main conference but take place in proximity. 

Regional hubs are meant to expand the network of DH work beyond the main conference. We encourage hosts to imagine new possibilities for collaboration with regional institutions outside higher education (e.g., cultural organizations, museums, historical societies, and libraries), and engage audiences through multilingual programming. In the past, hosts have organized local workshops, watch parties, mini symposia, field trips, and social gatherings.

## Application
Interested parties can apply for limited funding to defray some costs associated with hosting. Successful applicants will receive up to $500 toward hosting a regional hub. Proposed expenses are subject to approval. To apply for these funds, regional hub hosts must submit a letter of approval from their institution.

Hosts should submit an abstract outlining the following:
- How will the regional hub interact with the main conference (i.e. watch parties, supplemental panels, outside events?) Will it be offered online or in-person?  
- What is the particular regional character of the hub? How will you recruit participants?  
- Who are the potential partners or collaborators in organizing the regional hub?  
- What is the time zone of your proposed regional hub, and have you anticipated how to leverage time differences for your audience?  
- How do you plan to use funds from ACH to support your regional hub? (Note: Proposed expenses are subject to ACH approval.)  

Please complete the [Host Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOuEUS6sHO757LuWoZFLf5Y7BM7bZx9HDa6zrGrj1h7CUSOg/viewform) with your contact information and a 500-word abstract addressing the above via our Google Form. 

For questions and concerns about the regional hubs, please contact the ACH at conference [at] ach [dot] org. Hosts will be notified by March 15 and will be responsible for organizing and recruiting participants for their hub. Each hub will be expected to adhere to the [ACH Code of Conduct](https://ach2026.ach.org/en/policies/code-of-conduct/).
