## Selecting the Keynote Speakers
In choosing this year’s keynote theme of “Accessibility and Digital Scholarship,” we chose to underscore the values that shape this virtual conference, articulated in our original [call for proposals](https://ach2025.ach.org/en/cfp/):

> *“ACH 2025 is guided by our commitments to equity and justice. The conference recognizes that digital humanities scholarship is inextricably sociopolitical. Therefore, we have chosen to forgo a theme to emphasize the inherent sociopolitical nature of the work and encourage all proposal writers to explicitly address the sociopolitical stakes of their work.*

> *ACH 2025 prioritizes proposals that focus on social justice in multiple contexts: anti-racist work, Indigenous studies, cultural and critical ethnic studies, intersectional feminism, postcolonial and decolonial studies, disability studies, and queer studies.”*

We explored many possible themes before deciding that questions of accessibility were the most pressing during this third year of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the push to “return to normal,” we thought of those who cannot or will not resume a pre-pandemic life, and of the urgency of ensuring accessibility in digital scholarship and virtual spaces moving forward. We were particularly drawn to the work of Jasmine Clark and M. Remi Yergeau, who have dedicated their academic careers to exploring questions of accessibility in digital spheres. 

Jasmine Clark’s work emphasizes the importance of accessibility standards in virtual reality and in library technology. Her January 2023 article, co-written with Zack Lischer-Katz, “argues that critical failures in designing and implementing accessibility programs for emerging technologies in academic libraries point to the broader technocratic imperatives of contemporary universities operating under the logics of neoliberalism. Accessibility is an afterthought in this context, forcing users to adjust their bodies and senses to conform to the master plans of technology designers and evangelists.” [1]

The [Digital Accessible Futures Lab](https://accessiblefutures.net/), which M. Remi Yergeau directs, “examines pressing issues at the intersections of disability justice, techno-ableism, anti-racist praxis, and crip joy. We seek to dismantle ableist infrastructures in our everyday work. We root our practice in collective care and the deep learning that attends lived experience of disability. We join those who’ve come before us in imagining just crip futures.” We were particularly drawn to Dr. Yergeau’s work on crip-centered experiences, including *[Crip Time Travel](https://accessiblefutures.net/projects/)*.
