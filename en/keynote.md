**Keynote Abstract**
*Keep Calm; Float On: Data Rescue and You*
Concern for the continued access to and preservation of public federal data drove the development of the Data Rescue Project (DRP), a grassroots, community-led effort, in February 2025. This presentation will focus on efforts in the library community and beyond to rescue federal public data at risk of loss or deletion. It will review the development of the DRP and its current initiatives and consider future challenges for public data infrastructure in the United States.
