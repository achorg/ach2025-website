**Keynote Title and Abstract** 
*Civic Jugaad: Reclaiming Digital Innovation for Social Good”*
Many scholars and practitioners in the digital humanities (including me) are struggling to adapt their work to respond to crises around them. Building on the concept of jugaad—creative community problem-solving across the Indian sub-continent—I will explore projects and methods that inspire me to reclaim digital innovation for justice in community settings. I offer the under-construction concept of civic jugaad to think out loud about how imaginative practices can be added to trends of AI for good, data storytelling, and public interest technology in order to align work with the needs of threatened communities. Through examples I’ll introduce ways to use whatever materials you have at hand for practices that contest what is “good” in AI applications, tell more impactful data stories, create playful and healing civic technology, and more.

**Keynote Title and Abstract**
*Keep Calm; Float On: Data Rescue and You*
Concern for the continued access to and preservation of public federal data drove the development of the Data Rescue Project (DRP), a grassroots, community-led effort, in February 2025. This presentation will focus on efforts in the library community and beyond to rescue federal public data at risk of loss or deletion. It will review the development of the DRP and its current initiatives and consider future challenges for public data infrastructure in the United States.

### “Funding DH: Past, Present, and Future” 

A special session with colleagues from the National Endowment for the Humanities, led by Hannah Alpert-Abrams. 

_This one-hour roundtable discussion will feature people formerly or currently affiliated with federal funding agencies, talking about the role that these agencies have played in shaping the field. The panel will open with brief presentations on the history of federal funding for digital humanities and current events in the federal government. We will then have a moderated conversation in which we will talk about where NEH and IMLS fit in the DH ecosystem, and what may be possible moving forward._
